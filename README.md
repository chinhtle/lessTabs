#Less Tabs for sublime text 3

Are you tired of closing tabs manually ?

Do you want to close all old tabs with one command ?

After installing the plugin, press `ctrl + alt + c` and all the tabs that wasn't modified in the last 30 minutes (customize from settings) will be closed.

Files with unsaved changes will not be closed.

Files that were visited in the last minute will not be closed. (customize from settings)

##Installation
### Now available through [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control)!

##Usage

The default shortcut for closing tabs using lessTabs plugin is `ctrl + alt + c`.

There is also a command in the command palette `Less tabs: close old tabs`

##Features

- By setting the value of the setting value "close_on_open_new" to true, the plugin will execute the closing command when a new tab is opened.

- Close unrelated tabs to the open project.

- Close unrelated tabs to the directory of the current open tab (tab with focus).

- Close unrelated tabs to a user input directory.

##Stay tuned

I'm working on another package called **moreTabs**, that will help you open closed tabs in a much easier way.

##Credit
I got the idea at the first place from this plugin **TidyTabs** https://github.com/bradleyboy/TidyTabs-Sublime.

His plugin isn't sublime text 3 compatible so i made this one.
